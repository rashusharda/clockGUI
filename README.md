# Real-Time Display Python Code

This Python script demonstrates real-time data display using a simple graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to visualize and update data in real-time, making it useful for various applications such as monitoring sensor readings, live data streams, or any other time-sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the code.

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python sourceCode.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upon running the script, a GUI window will open displaying a real-time clock.

2. You can modify the script to use your own data source or modify the plot settings to suit your requirements.

3. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or close the GUI window to stop the script.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to better fit your needs:

- Adjust the data source: Modify the data generation logic to use your own data source, such as reading data from sensors, APIs, or databases.

- Change plot parameters: Modify the plot settings, such as labels, colors, or line styles, to match your preferences.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure you have the required libraries installed and that your Python environment is set up correctly.

## Acknowledgments

This code was inspired by the need for real-time data visualization in various applications.  Special thanks to the open-source community for developing and maintaining these tools.
